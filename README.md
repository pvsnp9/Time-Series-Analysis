# Time-Series-Analysis
Time Series Analysis in Python - Modeling: AR to SARIMAX, Vector Models, GARCH, Auto ARIMA, Forecasting


## How

- Does a commercial bank forecast the expected performance of their loan portfolio?

- Does an investment manager estimate a stock portfolioâ€™s risk?

- Which are the quantitative methods used to predict real-estate properties?

## Tools

- AR (autoregressive model)

- MA (moving-average model)

- ARMA (autoregressive-moving-average model)

- ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average model)

- ARIMAX (autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous variables)

- SARIA (seasonal autoregressive moving average model)

- SARIMA (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model)

- SARIMAX (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous variables)

- ARCH (autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model)

- GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model)

- VARMA (vector autoregressive moving average model)
